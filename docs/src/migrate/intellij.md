# How to Migrate from IntelliJ IDEA to Orion Studio

This guide covers how to set up Orion Studio if you're coming from IntelliJ IDEA, including keybindings, settings, and the differences you should expect.

## Install Orion Studio

Follow the [installation guide](../installation.md). Build from source or use a
verified artifact published by the Orion Studio repository; do not substitute
an upstream Zed package.

After installation, you can launch Orion Studio from your Applications folder (macOS), Start menu (Windows), or directly from the terminal using:
`orion .`
This opens the current directory in Orion Studio.

## Set Up the JetBrains Keymap

If you're coming from IntelliJ, the fastest way to feel at home is to use the JetBrains keymap. During onboarding, you can select it as your base keymap. If you missed that step, you can change it anytime:

1. Open Settings with `Cmd+,` (macOS) or `Ctrl+,` (Linux/Windows)
2. Search for `Base Keymap`
3. Select `JetBrains`

This maps familiar shortcuts like `Shift Shift` for Search Everywhere, `Cmd+O` for Go to Class, and `Cmd+Shift+A` for Find Action.

## Set Up Editor Preferences

You can configure most settings in the Settings Editor ({#kb zed::OpenSettings}). For advanced settings, run {#action zed::OpenSettingsFile} from the Command Palette to edit your settings file directly.

Settings IntelliJ users typically configure first:

| Orion Studio Setting    | What it does                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `format_on_save`        | Auto-format when saving. Set to `"on"` to enable.                               |
| `soft_wrap`             | Wrap long lines. Options: `"none"`, `"editor_width"`, `"preferred_line_length"` |
| `preferred_line_length` | Column width for wrapping and rulers. Default is 80.                            |
| `inlay_hints`           | Show parameter names and type hints inline, like IntelliJ's hints.              |
| `relative_line_numbers` | Useful if you're coming from IdeaVim.                                           |

Orion Studio also supports per-project settings. Create a `.zed/settings.json` file in your project root to override global settings for that project, similar to how you might use `.idea` folders in IntelliJ. The `.zed` directory name is retained for project-format compatibility.

> **Tip:** If you're joining an existing project, check `format_on_save` before making your first commit. Otherwise you might accidentally reformat an entire file when you only meant to change one line.

## Open or Create a Project

After setup, press `Cmd+Shift+O` (with JetBrains keymap) to open a folder. This becomes your workspace in Orion Studio. Unlike IntelliJ, there's no project configuration wizard, no `.iml` files, and no SDK setup required.

To start a new project, create a directory using your terminal or file manager, then open it in Orion Studio. The editor will treat that folder as the root of your project.

You can also launch Orion Studio from the terminal inside any folder with:
`orion .`

Once inside a project:

- Use `Cmd+Shift+O` or `Cmd+E` to jump between files quickly (like IntelliJ's "Recent Files")
- Use `Cmd+Shift+A` or `Shift Shift` to open the Command Palette (like IntelliJ's "Search Everywhere")
- Use `Cmd+O` to search for symbols (like IntelliJ's "Go to Class")

Open buffers appear as tabs across the top. The Project Panel shows your file tree and Git status. Toggle it with `Cmd+1` (just like IntelliJ's Project tool window).

## Differences in Keybindings

If you chose the JetBrains keymap during onboarding, most of your shortcuts should already feel familiar. Here's a quick reference for how Orion Studio compares to IntelliJ.

### Common Shared Keybindings (Orion Studio with JetBrains keymap ↔ IntelliJ)

| Action                        | Shortcut                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Search Everywhere             | `Shift Shift`           |
| Find Action / Command Palette | `Cmd + Shift + A`       |
| Go to File                    | `Cmd + Shift + O`       |
| Go to Symbol / Class          | `Cmd + O`               |
| Recent Files                  | `Cmd + E`               |
| Go to Definition              | `Cmd + B`               |
| Find Usages                   | `Alt + F7`              |
| Rename Symbol                 | `Shift + F6`            |
| Reformat Code                 | `Cmd + Alt + L`         |
| Toggle Project Panel          | `Cmd + 1`               |
| Toggle Terminal               | `Alt + F12`             |
| Duplicate Line                | `Cmd + D`               |
| Delete Line                   | `Cmd + Backspace`       |
| Move Line Up/Down             | `Shift + Alt + Up/Down` |
| Expand/Shrink Selection       | `Alt + Up/Down`         |
| Comment Line                  | `Cmd + /`               |
| Go Back / Forward             | `Cmd + [` / `Cmd + ]`   |
| Toggle Breakpoint             | `Ctrl + F8`             |

### Different Keybindings (IntelliJ → Orion Studio)

| Action                 | IntelliJ    | Orion Studio (JetBrains keymap) |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| File Structure         | `Cmd + F12` | `Cmd + F12` (outline)           |
| Navigate to Next Error | `F2`        | `F2`                            |
| Run                    | `Ctrl + R`  | `Ctrl + Alt + R` (tasks)        |
| Debug                  | `Ctrl + D`  | `Alt + Shift + F9`              |
| Stop                   | `Cmd + F2`  | `Ctrl + F2`                     |

### Unique to Orion Studio

| Action            | Shortcut                   | Notes                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Toggle Right Dock | `Cmd + R`                  | Agent panel, notifications     |
| Split Panes       | `Cmd + K`, then arrow keys | Create splits in any direction |

### How to Customize Keybindings

- Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+A` or `Shift Shift`)
- Run {#action zed::OpenKeymap}

This opens a list of all available bindings. You can override individual shortcuts or remove conflicts.

Orion Studio also supports key sequences (multi-key shortcuts).

## Differences in User Interfaces

### No Indexing

If you've used IntelliJ on large projects, you know the wait: "Indexing..." can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 15 minutes depending on project size. IntelliJ builds a comprehensive index of your entire codebase to power its code intelligence, and it re-indexes when dependencies change or after builds.

Orion Studio doesn't index. You open a folder and start working immediately. File search and navigation work instantly regardless of project size.

IntelliJ's index powers features like finding all usages across your entire codebase, understanding class hierarchies, and detecting dead code. Orion Studio delegates this work to language servers, which may not analyze at the same depth.

**How to adapt:**

- For project-wide symbol search, use `Cmd+O` / Go to Symbol (relies on your language server)
- For finding files by name, use `Cmd+Shift+O` / Go to File
- For text search across files, use `Cmd+Shift+F`—this is fast even on large codebases
- If you need deep static analysis for JVM code, consider running IntelliJ's inspections as a separate step or using standalone tools like Checkstyle, PMD, or SpotBugs

### LSP vs. Native Language Intelligence

IntelliJ has its own language analysis engine built from scratch for each supported language. For Java, Kotlin, and other JVM languages, this engine understands your code thoroughly: it resolves types, tracks data flow, knows about framework annotations, and offers dozens of specialized refactorings.

Orion Studio uses the Language Server Protocol (LSP) for code intelligence. Each language has its own server: `jdtls` for Java, `rust-analyzer` for Rust, and so on.

For some languages, the LSP experience is excellent. TypeScript, Rust, and Go have mature language servers that provide fast, accurate completions, diagnostics, and refactorings. For JVM languages, the gap might be more noticeable. The Eclipse-based Java language server is capable, but it won't match IntelliJ's depth for things like:

- Spring and Jakarta EE annotation processing
- Complex refactorings (extract interface, pull members up, change signature with all callers)
- Framework-aware inspections
- Automatic import optimization with custom ordering rules

**How to adapt:**

- Use `Alt+Enter` for available code actions—the list will vary by language server
- For Java, ensure `jdtls` is properly configured with your JDK path in settings

### No Project Model

IntelliJ manages projects through `.idea` folders containing XML configuration files, `.iml` module definitions, SDK assignments, and run configurations. This model enables IntelliJ to understand multi-module projects, manage dependencies automatically, and persist complex run/debug setups.

Orion Studio has no project model. A project is a folder. There's no wizard, no SDK selection screen, no module configuration.

This means:

- Build commands are manual. Orion Studio doesn't detect Maven or Gradle projects.
- Run configurations don't exist. You define tasks or use the terminal.
- SDK management is external. Your language server uses whatever JDK is on your PATH.
- There are no module boundaries. Orion Studio sees folders, not project structure.

**How to adapt:**

- Create a `.zed/settings.json` in your project root for project-specific settings
- Define common commands in `tasks.json` (open via Command Palette: {#action zed::OpenTasks}):

```json
[
  {
    "label": "build",
    "command": "./gradlew build"
  },
  {
    "label": "run",
    "command": "./gradlew bootRun"
  },
  {
    "label": "test current file",
    "command": "./gradlew test --tests $ZED_STEM"
  }
]
```

- Use `Ctrl+Alt+R` to run tasks quickly
- Lean on your terminal (`Alt+F12`) for anything tasks don't cover
- For multi-module projects, you can open each module as a separate Orion Studio window, or open the root and navigate via file finder

### No Framework Integration

IntelliJ's value for enterprise Java development comes largely from its framework integration. Spring beans are understood and navigable. JPA entities get special treatment. Endpoints are indexed and searchable. Jakarta EE annotations modify how the IDE analyzes your code.

Orion Studio has none of this. The language server sees Java code as Java code, so it doesn't understand that `@Autowired` means something special or that this class is a REST controller.

Similarly for other stacks: no Rails integration, no Django awareness, no Angular/React-specific tooling beyond what the TypeScript language server provides.

**How to adapt:**

- Use grep and file search liberally. `Cmd+Shift+F` with a regex can find endpoint definitions, bean names, or annotation usages.
- Rely on your language server's "find references" (`Alt+F7`) for navigation—it works, just without framework context
- For Spring Boot, keep the Actuator endpoints or a separate tool for understanding bean wiring
- Consider using framework-specific CLI tools (Spring CLI, Rails generators) from Orion Studio's terminal

> **Tip:** For database work, pick up a dedicated tool like DataGrip, DBeaver, or TablePlus. Many developers who switch to Orion Studio keep DataGrip around specifically for SQL—it integrates well with your existing JetBrains license.

If your daily work depends heavily on framework-aware navigation and refactoring, you'll feel the gap. Orion Studio works best when you're comfortable navigating code through search rather than specialized tooling, or when your language has strong LSP support that covers most of what you need.

### Tool Windows vs. Docks

IntelliJ organizes auxiliary views into numbered tool windows (Project = 1, Git = 9, Terminal = Alt+F12, etc.). Orion Studio uses a similar concept called "docks":

| IntelliJ Tool Window | Orion Studio Equivalent | Shortcut (JetBrains keymap) |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Project (1)          | Project Panel           | `Cmd + 1`                   |
| Git (9 or Cmd+0)     | Git Panel               | `Cmd + 0`                   |
| Terminal (Alt+F12)   | Terminal Panel          | `Alt + F12`                 |
| Structure (7)        | Outline Panel           | `Cmd + 7`                   |
| Problems (6)         | Diagnostics             | `Cmd + 6`                   |
| Debug (5)            | Debug Panel             | `Cmd + 5`                   |

Orion Studio has three dock positions: left, bottom, and right. Panels can be moved between docks by dragging or through settings.

> **Tip:** IntelliJ has an "Override IDE shortcuts" setting that lets terminal shortcuts like `Ctrl+Left/Right` work normally. In Orion Studio, terminal keybindings are separate—check your keymap if familiar shortcuts aren't working in the terminal panel.

### Debugging

Both IntelliJ and Orion Studio offer integrated debugging, but the experience differs:

- Orion Studio's debugger uses the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP), supporting multiple languages
- Set breakpoints with `Ctrl+F8`
- Start debugging with `Alt+Shift+F9`
- Step through code with `F7` (step into), `F8` (step over), `Shift+F8` (step out)
- Continue execution with `F9`

The Debug Panel (`Cmd+5`) shows variables, call stack, and breakpoints—similar to IntelliJ's Debug tool window.

### Extensions vs. Plugins

IntelliJ has a large plugin catalog covering everything from language support to database tools to deployment integrations.

Orion Studio's extension catalog is smaller and more focused:

- Language support and syntax highlighting
- Themes
- Context servers

Several features that require plugins in other editors are built into Orion Studio:

- Real-time collaboration with voice chat
- AI coding assistance
- Built-in terminal
- Task runner
- LSP-based code intelligence

You won't find one-to-one replacements for every IntelliJ plugin, especially for framework-specific tools, database clients, or application server integrations. For those workflows, you may need to use external tools alongside Orion Studio.

## Collaboration in Orion Studio vs. IntelliJ

IntelliJ offers Code With Me as a separate plugin for collaboration. Orion Studio has collaboration built into the core experience.

- Open the Collab Panel in the left dock
- After a collaboration service is deployed, create a channel and [invite collaborators](../collaboration/overview.md)
- [Share your screen or codebase](../collaboration/overview.md) through that configured service

Once connected, you'll see each other's cursors, selections, and edits in real time. Voice chat is included. There's no need for separate tools or third-party logins.

## Using AI in Orion Studio

If you're used to AI assistants in IntelliJ (like GitHub Copilot or JetBrains AI), Orion Studio offers similar capabilities with more flexibility.

### Configuring GitHub Copilot

1. Open Settings with `Cmd+,` (macOS) or `Ctrl+,` (Linux/Windows)
2. Navigate to **AI → Edit Predictions**
3. Click **Configure** next to "Configure Providers"
4. Under **GitHub Copilot**, click **Sign in to GitHub**

Once signed in, just start typing. Orion Studio will offer suggestions inline for you to accept.

### Additional AI Options

To use other AI models in Orion Studio, you have several options:

- Use an [operator-deployed Orion model service](../account/zed-hosted-models.md), if one is configured.
- Bring your own [API keys](../ai/use-api-access.md), with no Orion account required
- Use [External Agents like Claude Agent](../ai/external-agents.md)

## Advanced Config and Productivity Tweaks

Orion Studio exposes advanced settings for power users who want to fine-tune their environment.

Here are a few useful tweaks:

**Format on Save:**

```json
"format_on_save": "on"
```

**Enable direnv support:**

```json
"load_direnv": "shell_hook"
```

**Configure language servers** (requires manual JSON editing): For Java development, you may want to configure the Java language server in your settings:

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "jdtls": {
      "settings": {
        "java_home": "/path/to/jdk"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
