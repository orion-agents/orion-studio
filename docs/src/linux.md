# Orion Studio on Linux

## Installation

No public Orion download endpoint or third-party Linux package is assumed to be
available. Build from [source](./development/linux.md), or install an artifact
that maintainers have published on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/orion-agents/orion-studio/releases) after
verifying its checksum, architecture, and release notes.

Release bundles work best on systems that:

- have a Vulkan compatible GPU available (for example Linux on an M-series MacBook)
- have a system-wide glibc
  - x86_64 (Intel/AMD): glibc version >= 2.31 (Ubuntu 20 and newer)
  - aarch64 (ARM): glibc version >= 2.35 (Ubuntu 22 and newer)

NixOS does not have a system-wide glibc by default. If you'd like to use our builds on NixOS, they may work if you install a glibc compatibility layer such as [nix-ld](https://github.com/Mic92/nix-ld).

You will need to build from source for:

- architectures other than 64-bit Intel or 64-bit ARM (for example a 32-bit or RISC-V machine)
- Redhat Enterprise Linux 8.x, Rocky Linux 8, AlmaLinux 8, Amazon Linux 2 on all architectures
- Redhat Enterprise Linux 9.x, Rocky Linux 9.3, AlmaLinux 8, Amazon Linux 2023 on aarch64 (x86_x64 OK)

Packages named `zed`, `zed-editor`, or similar install the upstream Zed product
unless their maintainer explicitly documents otherwise. They are not Orion
Studio compatibility packages.

### Installing a release bundle manually

Given a verified `orion-studio-linux-<arch>.tar.gz` artifact, unpack it and add
the packaged canonical `orion-studio` launcher to your path:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local
# extract orion-studio to ~/.local/orion-studio.app/
tar -xvf <path/to/download>.tar.gz -C ~/.local
# Link the canonical launcher and optional short alias.
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -sf ~/.local/orion-studio.app/bin/orion-studio ~/.local/bin/orion-studio
ln -sf ~/.local/bin/orion-studio ~/.local/bin/orion
```

Release bundles also include `zed` as a deprecated migration alias. Do not
create or replace that alias manually if the name belongs to an upstream Zed
installation.

If you'd like integration with an XDG-compatible desktop environment, you will also need to install the `.desktop` file:

```sh
install -D ~/.local/orion-studio.app/share/applications/com.orion.OrionStudio.desktop -t ~/.local/share/applications
sed -i "s|Icon=orion-studio|Icon=$HOME/.local/orion-studio.app/share/icons/hicolor/512x512/apps/orion-studio.png|g" ~/.local/share/applications/com.orion.OrionStudio.desktop
sed -i "s|Exec=orion-studio|Exec=$HOME/.local/orion-studio.app/bin/orion-studio|g" ~/.local/share/applications/com.orion.OrionStudio.desktop
```

## Uninstalling Orion Studio

### Standard Uninstall

If Orion Studio was installed using the repository installation script, pass
`--uninstall` to the canonical `orion-studio` launcher:

```sh
orion-studio --uninstall
```

This uninstalls the Orion Studio installation targeted by the launcher. If you
have multiple parallel installations, use the intended installation's absolute
path as described below.

If there are no errors, the shell will then prompt you whether you'd like to keep your preferences or delete them. After making a choice, you should see a message that Orion Studio was successfully uninstalled.

If `orion-studio` is not in your path, try one of these commands:

```sh
$HOME/.local/bin/orion-studio --uninstall
```

or the absolute path to your installation, such as

```sh
$HOME/.local/orion-studio.app/bin/orion-studio --uninstall
```

The first case can fail when the launcher symlink was not created or was
overwritten by another installation. The second works when the bundle is in its
default location.

If Orion Studio was installed elsewhere, invoke that bundle's `bin/orion-studio`
launcher with `--uninstall`.

### Package Manager

If Orion Studio was installed using a package manager, please consult the documentation for that package manager on how to uninstall a package.

## Troubleshooting

Linux works on a large variety of systems configured in many different ways. We primarily test Orion Studio on a vanilla Ubuntu setup, as it is the most common distribution our users use. That said, we do expect it to work on a wide variety of machines.

### Orion Studio fails to start

If you see an error like "/lib64/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.29' not found" it means that your distribution's version of glibc is too old. You can either upgrade your system, or [install Orion Studio from source](./development/linux.md).

### Graphics issues

#### Orion Studio fails to open windows

Orion Studio requires a GPU to run effectively. Under the hood, we use [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) to communicate with your GPU. If you are seeing problems with performance, or Orion Studio fails to load, it is possible that Vulkan is the culprit.

If you see a notification saying `Orion Studio failed to open a window: NoSupportedDeviceFound` this means that Vulkan cannot find a compatible GPU. You can try running [vkcube](https://github.com/krh/vkcube) (usually available as part of the `vulkaninfo` or `vulkan-tools` package on various distributions) to try to troubleshoot where the issue is coming from like so:

```sh
vkcube
```

> **_Note_**: Try running in both X11 and wayland modes by running `vkcube -m [x11|wayland]`. Some versions of `vkcube` use `vkcube` to run in X11 and `vkcube-wayland` to run in wayland.

This should output a line describing your current graphics setup and show a rotating cube. If this does not work, you should be able to fix it by installing Vulkan compatible GPU drivers, however in some cases there is no Vulkan support yet.

You can find out which graphics card Orion Studio is using by looking in the Orion Studio log (`~/.local/share/orion-studio/logs/Orion Studio.log`) for `Using GPU: ...`.

If you see errors like `ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED` or `GPU Crashed` or `ERROR_SURFACE_LOST_KHR` then you may be able to work around this by installing different drivers for your GPU, or by selecting a different GPU to run on. (See [#14225](https://github.com/orion-agents/orion-studio/issues/14225))

On some systems the file `/etc/prime-discrete` can be used to enforce the use of a discrete GPU using [PRIME](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PRIME). Depending on the details of your setup, you may need to change the contents of this file to "on" (to force discrete graphics) or "off" (to force integrated graphics).

On others, you may be able to set the environment variable `DRI_PRIME=1` when running Orion Studio to force the use of the discrete GPU.

If you're using an AMD GPU, you might get a 'Broken Pipe' error. Try using the RADV or Mesa drivers. (See [#13880](https://github.com/orion-agents/orion-studio/issues/13880))

If you are using `amdvlk`, the default open-source AMD graphics driver, you may find that Orion Studio consistently fails to launch. This is a known issue for some users, for example on Omarchy (see issue [#28851](https://github.com/orion-agents/orion-studio/issues/28851)). To fix this, you will need to use a different driver. We recommend removing the `amdvlk` and `lib32-amdvlk` packages and installing `vulkan-radeon` instead (see issue [#14141](https://github.com/orion-agents/orion-studio/issues/14141)).

For more information, the [Arch guide to Vulkan](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Vulkan) has some good steps that translate well to most distributions.

#### Forcing Orion Studio to use a specific GPU

There are a few different ways to force Orion Studio to use a specific GPU:

The diagnostic variables `ZED_DEVICE_ID` and `ZED_LOG` retain their upstream
names in the current runtime. They are compatibility identifiers, not product
branding.

##### Option A

You can use the `ZED_DEVICE_ID={device_id}` environment variable to specify the device ID of the GPU you wish to have Orion Studio use.

You can obtain the device ID of your GPU by running `lspci -nn | grep VGA` which will output each GPU on one line like:

```text
08:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation GA104 [GeForce RTX 3070] [10de:2484] (rev a1)
```

where the device ID here is `2484`. This value is in hexadecimal, so to force Orion Studio to use this specific GPU you would set the environment variable like so:

```sh
ZED_DEVICE_ID=0x2484 orion-studio
```

Make sure to export the variable if you choose to define it globally in a `.bashrc` or similar.

##### Option B

If you are using Mesa, run `MESA_VK_DEVICE_SELECT=list orion-studio --foreground` to
list available GPUs, then export `MESA_VK_DEVICE_SELECT=xxxx:yyyy` to choose a
device. You can fall back to XWayland by also exporting `WAYLAND_DISPLAY=""`.

##### Option C

Using [vkdevicechooser](https://github.com/jiriks74/vkdevicechooser).

#### Reporting graphics issues

If Vulkan is configured correctly, and Orion Studio is still not working for you, please [file an issue](https://github.com/orion-agents/orion-studio) with as much information as possible.

When reporting issues where Orion Studio fails to start due to graphics initialization errors on GitHub, it can be impossible to run the {#action zed::CopySystemSpecsIntoClipboard} command like we instruct you to in our issue template. We provide an alternative way to collect the system specs specifically for this situation.

Passing the `--system-specs` flag to Orion Studio like

```sh
orion-studio --system-specs
```

will print the system specs to the terminal like so. It is strongly recommended to copy the output verbatim into the issue on GitHub, as it uses markdown formatting to ensure the output is readable.

Additionally, it is extremely beneficial to provide the contents of your Orion Studio log when reporting such issues. The log is usually located at `~/.local/share/orion-studio/logs/Orion Studio.log`. The recommended process for producing a helpful log file is as follows:

```sh
truncate -s 0 ~/.local/share/orion-studio/logs/Orion Studio.log # Clear the log file
ZED_LOG=wgpu=info orion-studio .
cat ~/.local/share/orion-studio/logs/Orion Studio.log
# copy the output
```

Or, if you have the Orion Studio cli setup, you can do

```sh
ZED_LOG=wgpu=info orion-studio --foreground .
# copy the output
```

It is also highly recommended when pasting the log into a github issue, to do so with the following template:

> **_Note_**: The whitespace in the template is important, and will cause incorrect formatting if not preserved.

````markdown
<details><summary>Orion Studio Log</summary>

```
{orion-studio log contents}
```

</details>
````

This will cause the logs to be collapsed by default, making it easier to read the issue.

### I can't open any files

### Clicking links isn't working

These features are provided by XDG desktop portals, specifically:

- `org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser`
- `org.freedesktop.portal.OpenURI`

Some window managers, such as `Hyprland`, don't provide a file picker by default. See [this list](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Desktop_Portal#List_of_backends_and_interfaces) as a starting point for alternatives.

### Orion Studio isn't remembering my API keys or configured account login

This feature also requires XDG desktop portals, specifically:

- `org.freedesktop.portal.Secret` or
- `org.freedesktop.Secrets`

Orion Studio uses a system-provided keychain to store provider API keys and,
when an account service has been configured, its login token. Examples include
`gnome-keyring`, `KWallet`, and `keepassxc`.

### Could not start inotify

Orion Studio relies on inotify to watch your filesystem for changes. If you cannot start inotify then Orion Studio will not work reliably.

If you are seeing "too many open files" then first try `sysctl fs.inotify`.

- You should see that max_user_instances is 128 or higher (you can change the limit with `sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_instances=1024`). Orion Studio needs only 1 inotify instance.
- You should see that `max_user_watches` is 8000 or higher (you can change the limit with `sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=64000`). Orion Studio needs one watch per directory in all your open projects + one per git repository + a handful more for settings, themes, keymaps, extensions.

It is also possible that you are running out of file descriptors. You can check the limits with `ulimit` and update them by editing `/etc/security/limits.conf`.

### No sound or wrong output device

If you're not hearing any sound in Orion Studio or the audio is routed to the wrong device, it could be due to a mismatch between audio systems. Orion Studio relies on ALSA, while your system may be using PipeWire or PulseAudio. To resolve this, you need to configure ALSA to route audio through PipeWire/PulseAudio.

If your system uses PipeWire:

1. **Install the PipeWire ALSA plugin**

   On Debian-based systems, run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install pipewire-alsa
   ```

2. **Configure ALSA to use PipeWire**

   Add the following configuration to your ALSA settings file. You can use either `~/.asoundrc` (user-level) or `/etc/asound.conf` (system-wide):

   ```bash
   pcm.!default {
       type pipewire
   }

   ctl.!default {
       type pipewire
   }
   ```

3. **Restart your system**

### Forcing X11 scale factor

On X11 systems, Orion Studio automatically detects the appropriate scale factor for high-DPI displays. The scale factor is determined using the following priority order:

1. `GPUI_X11_SCALE_FACTOR` environment variable (if set)
2. `Xft.dpi` from X resources database (xrdb)
3. Automatic detection via RandR based on monitor resolution and physical size

If you want to customize the scale factor beyond what Orion Studio detects automatically, you have several options:

#### Check your current scale factor

You can verify if you have `Xft.dpi` set:

```sh
xrdb -query | grep Xft.dpi
```

If this command returns no output, Orion Studio is using RandR (X11's monitor management extension) to automatically calculate the scale factor based on your monitor's reported resolution and physical dimensions.

#### Option 1: Set Xft.dpi (X Resources Database)

`Xft.dpi` is a standard X11 setting that many applications use for consistent font and UI scaling. Setting this ensures Orion Studio scales the same way as other X11 applications that respect this setting.

Edit or create the `~/.Xresources` file:

```sh
vim ~/.Xresources
```

Add this line with your desired DPI:

```sh
Xft.dpi: 96
```

Common DPI values:

- `96` for standard 1x scaling
- `144` for 1.5x scaling
- `192` for 2x scaling
- `288` for 3x scaling

Load the configuration:

```sh
xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
```

Restart Orion Studio for the changes to take effect.

#### Option 2: Use the GPUI_X11_SCALE_FACTOR environment variable

This Orion Studio-specific environment variable directly sets the scale factor, bypassing all automatic detection.

```sh
GPUI_X11_SCALE_FACTOR=1.5 orion-studio
```

You can use decimal values (e.g., `1.25`, `1.5`, `2.0`) or set `GPUI_X11_SCALE_FACTOR=randr` to force RandR-based detection even when `Xft.dpi` is set.

To make this permanent, add it to your shell profile or desktop entry.

#### Option 3: Adjust system-wide RandR DPI

This changes the reported DPI for your entire X11 session, affecting how RandR calculates scaling for all applications that use it.

Add this to your `.xprofile` or `.xinitrc`:

```sh
xrandr --dpi 192
```

Replace `192` with your desired DPI value. This affects the system globally and will be used by Orion Studio's automatic RandR detection when `Xft.dpi` is not set.

### Font rendering parameters

On Linux, Orion Studio reads `ZED_FONTS_GAMMA` and `ZED_FONTS_GRAYSCALE_ENHANCED_CONTRAST` environment variables for the values to use for font rendering. Their `ZED_` prefix is retained as a runtime compatibility namespace.

`ZED_FONTS_GAMMA` corresponds to [getgamma](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwriterenderingparams-getgamma) values.
Allowed range [1.0, 2.2], other values are clipped.
Default: 1.8

`ZED_FONTS_GRAYSCALE_ENHANCED_CONTRAST` corresponds to [getgrayscaleenhancedcontrast](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dwrite_1/nf-dwrite_1-idwriterenderingparams1-getgrayscaleenhancedcontrast) values.
Allowed range: [0.0, ..), other values are clipped.
Default: 1.0
