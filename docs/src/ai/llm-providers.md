# LLM Providers

Use this page to choose which models power [the Orion Studio Agent](./zed-agent.md) and
other Orion Studio-owned AI features, including [Inline Assistant](./inline-assistant.md),
Git commit generation, thread summaries, and similar model-backed features.

Model access paths do not configure [External Agents](./external-agents.md) or
[Terminal Threads](./terminal-threads.md). External Agents and Terminal Threads
usually own their own model access, auth, and configuration.

Use the setup pages for provider-specific details. See [Agents](./agents.md) for
the difference between the Orion Studio Agent, External Agents, and Terminal Threads.
